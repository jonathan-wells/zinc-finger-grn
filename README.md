# Genomic clustering of KRAB-zinc fingers facilitates robust TE silencing.
Work in progress project trying to better understand the genomic and regulatory architecture of
animal zinc fingers (ZNFs). ZNFs are the largest family of animal transcription factors, and are
notable for their very rapid evolution and gene turnover. ZNFs are locked in a coevolutionary arms
race with transposable elements (TEs), which they silence through sequence-specific recognition of
TE sequences, followed by recruitment of heterochromatin machinery. The expression of ZNFs is
tightly controlled, and in most species studied thus far, they are expressed in a distinct wave
early in embrogenesis. In this work in progress project, we are attempting to better understand the
regulatory mechanisms which enable this tight control of expression, and early results suggest that
the physical colocalization of ZNFs in gene clusters plays an important role in this process.
