#Selection for robust silencing of transposable elements explains the genomic architecture of metazoan zinc finger genes

Work in progress project trying to better understand the genomic and regulatory architecture of
animal zinc fingers (ZFPs). ZFPs are the largest family of animal transcription factors, and are
notable for their very rapid evolution and gene turnover. Recent work has revealed that ZFPs are
locked in a coevolutionary arms race with transposable elements (TEs), which they silence through
sequence-specific recognition of TE sequences, followed by recruitment of heterochromatin machinery.
The expression of ZFPs is tightly controlled, and in most species studied thus far, they are
expressed in a distinct wave early in embrogenesis. In this work in progress project, we are
attempting to better understand the regulatory mechanisms which enable this tight control of
expression, and early results suggest that the physical colocalization of ZFPs in gene clusters
plays an important role in this process.
